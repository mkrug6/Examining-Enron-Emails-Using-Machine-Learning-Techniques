# Examining-Enron-Emails-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

## Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

### Explanation of Files and How-To

Unzip all files to a directory of your choice and execute poi_id.py.
analyse.py - analyzes the dataset and contains plot functions
feature_format.py - file from Udacity 
features.py - runs through machine learning programs and chooses the best one
outliers.py - finds and removes outliers from the dataset
poi_id.py - the main file. Run in python 2.7
tester.py - file from Udacity


### Requirements
This project uses the following tools with specific program versions:
nltk==3.2.1 numpy==1.11.2 scikit-learn==0.18 scipy==0.18.1

I used a virtual machine running Ubuntu 16.04 however you may use Anaconda or other tools as you see fit to set up your environment.
